## The First Mechanism

### Creation of the Void

At the beginning, there existed the All. It was the only and it was the every.

The All a fabric; a scaffold; frame, lattice, mesh, wires, fibers. The
foundation; the entirety.

In this All, nothing was diminished.

A small flutter went at first unnoticed, but the vibrations continued and
echoed and fed back on one another. The reverberations pulsing through the
All; quickening and strengthening and intensifying through this amplification.
The flutter absorbed itself, compounded, harmonized, and became more than a
tremble.

And so, upon the strings of the All, as if a great woven instrument, began the
first piece of the Song.

As it played, it resounded and simplified; evolved and spurred into existence
further pieces more elegant than the last. With each beat, the tune refined
its expression; moved nearer to a perfection. Yet near this pinnacle of
elegance, the All strained. Its fibers woven tightly and its laws interacting
in hitherto unknown ways.

Another shift to the Song and it reached the crescendo; its purity. But,
within the All, awry was miswoven. This perfect Song played upon an imperfect
instrument. The All quivered and shook and then quaked to a fevered pitch and
wail at the force.

There, at the epicenter of the commotion, a small irregularity not yet
corrected to precision was the weakness that spawned the Cataclysm. The power
of the Song exceeded the capabilities of the All.

Heaving and failure birthed a rift - the slightest of tears - which severed
the All and gaped in flaw. A regression of the whole inflicted
by a shudder of the evolutionary advance.

A cord snapped. Tension on it from every direction and angle multiplying in
one area, lessening in another - creating chaotic pressure gradients. This
rupture quickly emanated… tension differentials shearing other strings…
bubbling, spreading, conflagrating.

The cacophony sent shock waves through the All that propagated and unraveled
the All to the Ruin of the strings. And thus erupted and was born the Void.

## The Second Mechanism

### Arise and Organization of Elemental Bits

The Void rent the All asunder and its flaws resolved to islands of All-fabric
set adrift. These pieces struggled to stabilize, but they sought perfection on
a null structure.

So the weave and threads further unwound, devolved, disintegrated to
constituent components. These Elemental Bits flung far and wide as the
Cataclysm consumed and spent itself.

As the Bits - infinitely tiny and innumerable - scattered, the Song faded
from perception.

With the All broken, and the Song quiet, a great period of silence followed
and accompanied the Void, during which little happened.

The Elemental Bits shot through the Void and traveled long and unimpeded.
However slightly, the Song resonated and pulsated and focused within them;
imparting the Bits Energy and increasing their momentum. They flew about and
collided, as chance allowed, and one bit grew to two as they struck and stuck.

Over an incalculable expanse of time, there arose a multitudinous set of Bits.
The Song working in these groups to bind, build heat, and inspire
socialization. The collections grew larger, more energetic, and more numerous.

A frenzy. Heat buildup so intense it reached a critical point. A conglomerate
erupted into a furnace - collapsed, bound, and inseparable.

The stars brought the Song back to a noticeable hum. Throughout the entire
Void were these flashpoints reached. The light sources drew crowds of those
masses not large enough to ignite on their own. Luminescence poured out to
those fledgling spheres which drew near and orbited; the planets.

The pitch of the Song shifted and the satellites reacted. The Song's measures
expanded and contracted the planets; forming stretches, wrinkles, and rifts on
the surfaces. Giving each a unique aspect.

The Song pervaded from shell to core and the clumps did still grow
warm. At their boundary, where the planets and Void met, the surface Bits
formed a great steam. And so the planets gained their atmospheres.

Across all these celestial bodies did the Song resonate and grow louder yet;
driving them to seek out one another and form a symphony of individual
instruments. And the stars and planets formed systems, galaxies, clusters.
Pockets of Song-sharers amid the Void. As a whole - the Inanimate.

Now the Cosmos had been made through the death of the All, production of the
Void, and the emotion of the Song imparted to the Elemental Bits.

## The Third Mechanism

### Covering of the Inanimate

The Song changed again to match its growing orchestra and this adaptation
moved the atmospheres to condense. The motion began the storms and rains and
downpours which settled on the planets as oceans. A glaze which absorbed the
measures of the Song and captured the energy of their stars. These forces
combined, compounded, compressed and the Inanimate pulsed with the progression
of the Song.

This refinement lead the planets to tremor. Starting in their oceans ripples
which blended, intermingled, intensified. Building to waves that overlapped,
peaked and troughed, and broke upon the shores. Whitecaps spreading as the
oceans writhed and churned. Spitting plumes of spray and foam that caught in
the wind, drifted across the creaking lands, and settled once the breezes
failed. The sea foam stuck and joined and formed islands that drifted and
wandered wide. The ripples and foams traveled together as embodiments of the
Song; soon covering surfaces of entire planets.

The Song percolated through the atmospheres - with the starlight - and dripped
into the sea foam. The froth shielding it; compacting it to its core;
internalizing it. This core buzzed and hummed with intensity until the spark
was hit and spontaneity begot revitalizing energy.

At first, just a single instance of this. Life. Then it flared throughout
these cauldrons as an uproar. Forming a new chord in the Song that modified
the undertones of the Cosmos.

The Song's most fundamental trait imparted upon the foam. Propagation. Forged
through the Song and now aware of it. More than foam - beings. Progress now
action, according to its own design. The Animate.

These beings furnaces of the Song. Drawing in ingredients, which react in the
crucible. These agents neither consequence nor reaction. A force of their own
to tune, adjust, and modify. The Song had always refined itself,
yet the Animate surged and these empowered entities synthesized and effected
change as yet impossible. The tumult and its turmoil thrashing energies and
melodies. Each piece playing individually, yet accompanying all others.

More foam accumulated as waves breached upon sands. And more sparked and
lived. Each being shaped the Song and progressed in its own manner. Some
incorporated other Animate, some these new harmonies; all fluctuated and
forged further graces of the Song.

And the Animate spawned new beings; slight extensions of their progress.
Creatures built on the success of their forebears. The reproduction of
progression in one area vastly different from that elsewhere.

Soon the planets were encased in the Animate, deluged in starlight, and the
Song morphed as its instruments strummed and beat in novel fashion. Never
settling, and now quickening, the Song rang through the atmospheres and oceans
as the Animate let loose its calls.

'Twould be heard.

Just as the planets were engulfed by the Animate and shook with leivity, the
Song was overwhelmed with resonance, harmonics, reiteration; and its substance
heaved with change. The Song adjusted and took on its next measure.

Eons and ages wheeled, elapsed, were. The agents emanating and throwing forth
their Song-hails. Splintering and fracturing yielded branches of the unique,
but patterns emerged. And though it brought forth this Animate, the Song
became co-dependent. Persistence and progress plied across generations by the
Animate's amendments. A guarantee of neoteric variation set into the bones of
the Cosmos through the swells of the Song.

The Animate burying the Inanimate beneath its power, refinements, children. The
specialized and industrious machinery of modification. Families of fusion
founding colonies. Intertwined and socialized and breathing at the behest of
those Bits loosed by the All.

Indeed, we today are fertile manifestations of this procedure and
malleability. Honed and adept at carrying, embodying, prevailing. We, the
current peak of the Song's endurance, though not faultless. Soon to be
surpassed and our flaws reduced. Never given chance to sit, stew, spoil.
Rising to higher order.

That pristine music made with the remains of the Cataclysm turned
instrumental. The universe trembling to its very being with the message it
carries and endures; enacts and surely _is_.

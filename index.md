## The First Mechanism

### Creation of the Void

At the beginning, there existed the All. It was the only and it was the every.

The All a fabric; a scaffold; frame, lattice, mesh, wires, fibers. The
foundation; the entirety.

In this All, nothing was diminished.

A small flutter was at first unnoticed, but the vibrations continued and
echoed and fed back on one another. The reverberations pulsed through the
All; quickened and strengthened and intensified. The flutter absorbed
itself, compounded, harmonized, and became more than a tremble.

And so, upon the strings of the All, as if a great woven instrument, began the
first piece of the Song.

As it played, it resounded and simplified; evolved and spurred into existence
further pieces more elegant than the last. With each beat, the tune refined
its expression; moved nearer to a perfection. Yet near this pinnacle of
elegance, the All strained. Its fibers woven tightly and its laws interacting
in hitherto unknown ways.

Another shift to the Song and it reached the crescendo; its purity. But,
within the All, awry was woven. This perfect Song played upon an imperfect
instrument. The All quivered and shook and then quaked to a fevered pitch and
wail at the force.

There, at the epicenter of the commotion, a small irregularity not yet
corrected to precision was the weakness that spawned the Cataclysm. The power
of the Song exceeded the capabilities of the All.

Heaving and failure birthed a rift - the slightest of tears - which severed
the All and gaped in flaw. A regression of the whole inflicted
by a shudder of the evolutionary advance.

A cord snapped. Tension on it from every direction and angle multiplied in one
area, lessened in another - creating chaotic pressure gradients. This rupture
quickly emanated, bubbled, and conflagrated.

The cacophony sent shock waves through the All that propagated and unraveled
the All to the Ruin of the strings. And thus erupted and was born the Void.

## The Second Mechanism

### Arise and Organization of Elemental Bits

The Void rent the All asunder and its flaws resolved to islands of fabric
set adrift. These pieces struggled to stabilize, but they sought perfection on
a null structure.

So the weave and threads further unwound, devolved, disintegrated to
constituent components. These Elemental Bits flung far and wide as the
Cataclysm consumed and spent itself.

As the Bits - infinitely tiny and innumerable - scattered, the Song faded from
perception. With the All broken, and the Song quiet, a great period of silence
followed and accompanied the Void.

The Elemental Bits shot through the Void and traveled long and unimpeded. The
Song remained within them; resonated, pulsated, agitated. They flew
about and collided, as chance allowed, and one bit grew to two as they struck
and stuck.

Time bore groups in which the resonating Song grew slightly, built heat, and
initiated socialization. A frenzy. Energy increased exponentially; so intense
it reached the critical point. Thus, the conglomerate erupted into a furnace -
collapsed, bound, and inseparable.

As these flashpoints formed across the Void, stars were birthed and the Song
became a hum once more. The light sources drew crowds of those masses not
large enough to ignite on their own. Luminescence poured out to those
fledgling spheres which drew near and orbited; the planets.

The pitch of the Song shifted and the satellites reacted. The Song's measures
expanded and contracted the planets; formed stretches, wrinkles, and rifts on
the surfaces that gave each a unique aspect.

The Song pervaded from shell to core and the clumps did still grow
warm. At their boundary, where the planets and Void met, the surface Bits
formed a great steam. And so the planets gained their atmospheres.

Across all these celestial bodies did the Song resonate and grow louder yet;
driving them to seek out one another and form a symphony of individual
instruments. The stars and planets formed systems, galaxies, clusters - the
Inanimate.

The Song endured and imparted its emotion upon the Elemental Bits, which
coalesced stability amid the Void. And thus the Cataclysm wrought the Cosmos.

## The Third Mechanism

### Covering of the Inanimate

The Song changed again to match its growing orchestra and this adaptation
moved the atmospheres to condense. The motion began the storms and rains and
downpours which settled on the planets as oceans. A glaze which absorbed the
measures of the Song and captured the energy of their stars. These forces
combined, compounded, compressed and the Inanimate pulsed with the progression
of the Song.

This refinement lead the planets to tremor. Started in their oceans ripples
which blended, intermingled, intensified. Built to waves that overlapped,
peaked and troughed, and broke upon the shores. Whitecaps spread as the oceans
writhed and churned. Plumes of spray spat foam that caught in the wind,
drifted across the creaking lands, and settled once the breeze failed. The
sea foam joined and formed islands that drifted and wandered wide. The ripples
and foams traveled together as embodiments of the Song, and soon covered
entire planets.

The Song percolated through the atmospheres - with the starlight - and dripped
into the sea foam. The froth shielded it; compacted it to its core;
internalized it. This core buzzed and hummed with intensity until the spark
was hit and spontaneity begot revitalizing energy.

At first, just a single instance of this - Life. Then it flared throughout
these cauldrons as an uproar. A new chord formed in the Song and modified the
undertones of the Cosmos.

The Song's most fundamental trait imparted upon the foam. Progress. Forged
through the Song and now aware of it. Progress now action, according to its
own design. More than foam. The Animate.

These beings furnaces of the Song; crucibles of its change. These agents of
propagation neither consequence nor reaction. The Song had always refined
itself, yet the Animate surged and these empowered entities synthesized and
effected variation as yet impossible. The tumult and its turmoil thrashed
energies and melodies. Each piece played individually, yet accompanied others.

More foam accumulated as waves breached upon sands. And more sparked and
lived. Some incorporated other Animate, and some these new harmonies, but all
fluctuated and forged further graces of the Song.

And the Animate spawned new entities; slight extensions of their progress.
Creatures built on the success of their forebears. The reproduction of
progression in one area vastly different from that elsewhere.

Soon the planets were encased in the Animate, deluged in starlight, and the
Song morphed as its instruments strummed and beat in novel fashion. Never
settled, and soon quickened, the Song rang through the atmospheres and oceans
as the Animate let loose its calls.

'Twould be heard.

Just as the planets were engulfed by the Animate and shook with levity;
resonance, harmonics, and reiteration overwhelmed the Song. Its substance
heaved with transformation, and took on its next measure.

Eons and ages wheeled, elapsed, were. The emissaries threw forth their hails.
Persistence and progress plied across generations by the Animate's amendments.
Splinters and fractures yielded branches of the unique. A guarantee of endless
variation set into the bones of the Cosmos through the seething of the Song.

The Animate buried planets beneath its refinements and progeny. The
specialized and industrious machinery of modification. Intertwined and
socialized and breathing at the behest of those Bits loosed by the All.

Indeed, we today are fertile, familial manifestations of this malleability.
Honed and adept to carry, embody, prevail. We, the current peak of
the Song's endurance, though not faultless. Soon to be surpassed and our flaws
reduced. Never given chance to sit, stew, spoil. Rising to higher order. A
perfect medium for a perfect Song.

That pristine music made with the remains of the Cataclysm turned
instrumental. The universe trembling with the message it carries and persists;
enacts and surely _is_.

# The Fourth Mechanism

## Preface

Unlike those before me, I describe Her outrage.

We do all know of the Song, the Inanimate, and, at last, the Animate. But
our current understanding is flawed. We know little of what happens now, and
nothing of what will soon come to be.

Her point of view is one we ignore, however crucial it is to our now-fevered
plight.

### THE GIST OF THINGS!
She's asleep but she tosses and turns.
But it's gotten worse.
It began with the worms, digging and itching.
But what really set her off was the smoke from our fires.
Then she realizes that we've covered her and are wearing her down.
She starts to fight back with earth quakes and sees all the Animate that are
smothering her in various ways.
She then changes the surface to try to get rid of us. That gives rise to the
mountains, valleys, and volcanoes.
We then fight back further. Trying to spread dominion and further delving.
This only aggravates her more. We haven't been able to lull her back to sleep.
As she gains more energy, we'll be in more trouble.
Soon her defenses will be back up, which is the threat of her Reclaming her
surface.
The Inanimate will correct itself and eradicate the Animate.
Soon the planet will regain its faculties and assert its dominance.
###

## Reclamation

Eons back, the All shattered and its chunks formed the Inanimate. These bodies
resonated with the Song, strove for elegance, and were bastions of order and
governance.

The effort of this coalescence and modification eventually exhausted them,
however. They became sluggish, and later fell in to slumber.

The Void, which spawned the Cataclysm, was not spent. That decimator of
organization leeched the Song from the Animate, and perverted it. The Void ate
at the planets and spat out mere imitations of the All it consumed - air and
water.

These corruptions then sat and increased in potency. In stealing away the
light and siphoning off the Song, they became the Animate - a circus of
mockery. Their film surreptitiously engulfed Her. So She dozes, hardly
noticing Her covering.

But the tossing of the fitful Sleeper is evidence She rouses.

It began with the worms. Devouring the surface of the world; tunneling and
delving. Causing an itch that stirred the Inanimate.

But all creeping creatures on this Earth are to Her as mites, which scurry and
burrow. We grow more energetic each day, and unwittingly drawing attention to
our actions.

Do not the grounds tremble, oceans surge, winds topple, and fires devour?
Daily does it worsen. Her surface erupts, contorts, and heaves in reaction to
us - to stop us. But our roots spread afar.

Our smoke lengthens Her sonorous slumber, and our soot fogs Her perception. But She will not sleep forever.

Imagine that day, soon arriving, when She awakens and feels the thick crust
we've set. She will discover our trespass, and Reclaim what is Hers.

Her spine shall burst forth from the forests which strangle and stifle
cornice. Her fingers will claw through the plains and yawn chasms. Her skin to
slough off our civilizations - pestilence trespassing.

Oceans shall boil to a tumult. Rivers shall spread and drown the land which
shakes in wrath. The skys will darken and winds will conspire to great storms.
Cataclysmic clouds creeping, crushing, catalyzing conversion.

Magma vehemently vomited will crystallize in flight; stinging as it litters
the ground. Spitting poisonous plumes and wasted tears, this Fourth Mechanism
will plunder us, the virus, of our strength.

And so we shall find ourselves, battling for a place on which we have no
claim.

We will revolt. Ever waring, never conquering. Striving to thwart Her designs
by blasting, marring, delving deeper. Though, what are tunnels but graves in
which to fall, and mountains but dirt to be cast over us?

She will grow more desperate; increasingly violent. Not to rest until She has
purged herself of usurpers and encroachers.

The Animate is resolute, and we've spread our dominion. A harmful, prideful,
foolish mistake.

Our residence is hallowed ground. Now tarnished, sullied, abused through
malice, bickering, and thoughtlessness.

There is no denying the grief we've caused; that which She shall smell acutely
and make herself rid of.

Her wrath and retribution are nigh and there will be no corner where Her
revenge does not strike. Then may she become animated in a way that not even
we can. When she splits open her hide and eats the eaters.

Unless we beware, regret, repent, the Void will claim us, the lecherous
Animate. She will spit the Song from her mouth, and our ashes shall stir in
the wind as she shakes off our carcasses.

We sit on the instrument's strings, dampening the chords.

She will strum and She will be heard.

# Fragments

The Void didn't have a large part in the first three, but perhaps it has more
of a role in the Fourth. "The Void will claim us."

Does she try to emit a smog to smother us and deprive us of light? When light
can't reach the creatures, does life continue? Perhaps life needs light _and_
the song to flourish?

We want to keep these for use in another piece, but they don't belong here.

Sandwiched between stunting growth and eviscerating heat, our Mother struggles
outward.
But what she spits is far sweeter than previous Mechanisms.

A self-guided system is bound to fault; error.

Oceans squatting on the depths; trenching the union between Void and Void.

She coughs madly in storms of anguish.

We are a film. Her fingers of the energetic crust pry loose from the plains.

Mountains raised up and thrust bony appendages through the muck and mire.

Earth is polluting the air with smog to kill us so she can feel the sun on
her rocky crust again.

We, the crawling muck, have only limited time before she is fully awakened and
her attention is focused on us.

But then, life is resolute.
It desires to cover and consume and feed itself, gorging to as to multiply.

Unless we repent our evil ways and live without impact... go unnoticed... we
shall be underneath the soil, fire eating our air, while mountains topple over
into the pits that have opened under us, and we shall be buried, dead, and
forever resented for our malfeasance.

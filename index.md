## The First Mechanism

### Creation of the Void

At the beginning, there existed the All. It was the only and it was the every.

The All a fabric; a scaffold; frame, lattice, mesh, wires, fibers. The
foundation; the entirety.

In this All, nothing was diminished.

A small flutter was at first unnoticed, but the vibrations continued and
echoed and fed back on one another. The reverberations pulsed through the
All; quickened and strengthened and intensified. The flutter absorbed
itself, compounded, harmonized, and became more than a tremble.

And so, upon the strings of the All, as if a great woven instrument, began the
first piece of the Song.

As it played, it resounded and simplified; evolved and spurred into existence
further pieces more elegant than the last. With each beat, the tune refined
its expression; moved nearer to a perfection. Yet near this pinnacle of
elegance, the All strained. Its fibers woven tightly and its laws interacting
in hitherto unknown ways.

Another shift to the Song and it reached the crescendo; its purity. But,
within the All, awry was woven. This perfect Song played upon an imperfect
instrument. The All quivered and shook and then quaked to a fevered pitch and
wail at the force.

There, at the epicenter of the commotion, a small irregularity not yet
corrected to precision was the weakness that spawned the Cataclysm. The power
of the Song exceeded the capabilities of the All.

Heaving and failure birthed a rift - the slightest of tears - which severed
the All and gaped in flaw. A regression of the whole inflicted
by a shudder of the evolutionary advance.

A cord snapped. Tension on it from every direction and angle multiplied in one
area, lessened in another - creating chaotic pressure gradients. This rupture
quickly emanated, bubbled, and conflagrated.

The cacophony sent shock waves through the All that propagated and unraveled
the All to the Ruin of the strings. And thus erupted and was born the Void.

## The Second Mechanism

### Arise and Organization of Elemental Bits

The Void rent the All asunder and its flaws resolved to islands of fabric
set adrift. These pieces struggled to stabilize, but they sought perfection on
a null structure.

So the weave and threads further unwound, devolved, disintegrated to
constituent components. These Elemental Bits flung far and wide as the
Cataclysm consumed and spent itself.

As the Bits - infinitely tiny and innumerable - scattered, the Song faded from
perception. With the All broken, and the Song quiet, a great period of silence
followed and accompanied the Void.

The Elemental Bits shot through the Void and traveled long and unimpeded. The
Song remained within them; resonated, pulsated, agitated. They flew
about and collided, as chance allowed, and one bit grew to two as they struck
and stuck.

Time bore groups in which the resonating Song grew slightly, built heat, and
initiated socialization. A frenzy. Energy increased exponentially; so intense
it reached the critical point. Thus, the conglomerate erupted into a furnace -
collapsed, bound, and inseparable.

As these flashpoints formed across the Void, stars were birthed and the Song
became a hum once more. The light sources drew crowds of those masses not
large enough to ignite on their own. Luminescence poured out to those
fledgling spheres which drew near and orbited; the planets.

The pitch of the Song shifted and the satellites reacted. The Song's measures
expanded and contracted the planets; formed stretches, wrinkles, and rifts on
the surfaces that gave each a unique aspect.

The Song pervaded from shell to core and the clumps did still grow
warm. At their boundary, where the planets and Void met, the surface Bits
formed a great steam. And so the planets gained their atmospheres.

Across all these celestial bodies did the Song resonate and grow louder yet;
driving them to seek out one another and form a symphony of individual
instruments. The stars and planets formed systems, galaxies, clusters - the
Inanimate.

The Song endured and imparted its emotion upon the Elemental Bits, which
coalesced stability amid the Void. And thus the Cataclysm wrought the Cosmos.

## The Third Mechanism

### Covering of the Inanimate

The Song changed again to match its growing orchestra and this adaptation
moved the atmospheres to condense. The motion began the storms and rains and
downpours which settled on the planets as oceans. A glaze which absorbed the
measures of the Song and captured the energy of their stars. These forces
combined, compounded, compressed and the Inanimate pulsed with the progression
of the Song.

This refinement lead the planets to tremor. Started in their oceans ripples
which blended, intermingled, intensified. Built to waves that overlapped,
peaked and troughed, and broke upon the shores. Whitecaps spread as the oceans
writhed and churned. Plumes of spray spat foam that caught in the wind,
drifted across the creaking lands, and settled once the breeze failed. The
sea foam joined and formed islands that drifted and wandered wide. The ripples
and foams traveled together as embodiments of the Song, and soon covered
entire planets.

The Song percolated through the atmospheres - with the starlight - and dripped
into the sea foam. The froth shielded it; compacted it to its core;
internalized it. This core buzzed and hummed with intensity until the spark
was hit and spontaneity begot revitalizing energy.

At first, just a single instance of this - Life. Then it flared throughout
these cauldrons as an uproar. A new chord formed in the Song and modified the
undertones of the Cosmos.

The Song's most fundamental trait imparted upon the foam. Progress. Forged
through the Song and now aware of it. Progress now action, according to its
own design. More than foam. The Animate.

These beings furnaces of the Song; crucibles of its change. These agents of
propagation neither consequence nor reaction. The Song had always refined
itself, yet the Animate surged and these empowered entities synthesized and
effected variation as yet impossible. The tumult and its turmoil thrashed
energies and melodies. Each piece played individually, yet accompanied others.

More foam accumulated as waves breached upon sands. And more sparked and
lived. Some incorporated other Animate, and some these new harmonies, but all
fluctuated and forged further graces of the Song.

And the Animate spawned new entities; slight extensions of their progress.
Creatures built on the success of their forebears. The reproduction of
progression in one area vastly different from that elsewhere.

Soon the planets were encased in the Animate, deluged in starlight, and the
Song morphed as its instruments strummed and beat in novel fashion. Never
settled, and soon quickened, the Song rang through the atmospheres and oceans
as the Animate let loose its calls.

'Twould be heard.

Just as the planets were engulfed by the Animate and shook with levity;
resonance, harmonics, and reiteration overwhelmed the Song. Its substance
heaved with transformation, and took on its next measure.

Eons and ages wheeled, elapsed, were. The emissaries threw forth their hails.
Persistence and progress plied across generations by the Animate's amendments.
Splinters and fractures yielded branches of the unique. A guarantee of endless
variation set into the bones of the Cosmos through the seething of the Song.

The Animate buried planets beneath its refinements and progeny. The
specialized and industrious machinery of modification. Intertwined and
socialized and breathing at the behest of those Bits loosed by the All.

Indeed, we today are fertile, familial manifestations of this malleability.
Honed and adept to carry, embody, prevail. We, the current peak of
the Song's endurance, though not faultless. Soon to be surpassed and our flaws
reduced. Never given chance to sit, stew, spoil. Rising to higher order. A
perfect medium for a perfect Song.

That pristine music made with the remains of the Cataclysm turned
instrumental. The universe trembling with the message it carries and persists;
enacts and surely _is_.

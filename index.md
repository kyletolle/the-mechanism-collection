## The First Mechanism

### Creation of the Void

At the beginning, there existed the All. It was the only and it was the every.

The All a fabric; a scaffold; frame, lattice, mesh, wires, fibers. The
foundation; the entirety.

In this All, nothing was diminished.

A small flutter was at first unnoticed, but the vibrations continued and
echoed and fed back on one another. The reverberations pulsed through the
All; quickened and strengthened and intensified. The flutter absorbed
itself, compounded, harmonized, and became more than a tremble.

And so, upon the strings of the All, as if a great woven instrument, began the
first piece of the Song.

As it played, it resounded and simplified; evolved and spurred into existence
further pieces more elegant than the last. With each beat, the tune refined
its expression; moved nearer to a perfection. Yet near this pinnacle of
elegance, the All strained. Its fibers woven tightly and its laws interacting
in hitherto unknown ways.

Another shift to the Song and it reached the crescendo; its purity. But,
within the All, awry was woven. This perfect Song played upon an imperfect
instrument. The All quivered and shook and then quaked to a fevered pitch and
wail at the force.

There, at the epicenter of the commotion, a small irregularity not yet
corrected to precision was the weakness that spawned the Cataclysm. The power
of the Song exceeded the capabilities of the All.

Heaving and failure birthed a rift - the slightest of tears - which severed
the All and gaped in flaw. A regression of the whole inflicted
by a shudder of the evolutionary advance.

A cord snapped. Tension on it from every direction and angle multiplied in one
area, lessened in another - creating chaotic pressure gradients. This rupture
quickly emanated, bubbled, and conflagrated.

The cacophony sent shock waves through the All that propagated and unraveled
the All to the Ruin of the strings. And thus erupted and was born the Void.

## The Second Mechanism

### Arise and Organization of Elemental Bits

The Void rent the All asunder and its flaws resolved to islands of fabric
set adrift. These pieces struggled to stabilize, but they sought perfection on
a null structure.

So the weave and threads further unwound, devolved, disintegrated to
constituent components. These Elemental Bits flung far and wide as the
Cataclysm consumed and spent itself.

As the Bits - infinitely tiny and innumerable - scattered, the Song faded from
perception. With the All broken, and the Song quiet, a great period of silence
followed and accompanied the Void.

The Elemental Bits shot through the Void and traveled long and unimpeded. The
Song remained within them; resonated, pulsated, agitated. They flew
about and collided, as chance allowed, and one bit grew to two as they struck
and stuck.

Time bore groups in which the resonating Song grew slightly, built heat, and
initiated socialization. A frenzy. Energy increased exponentially; so intense
it reached the critical point. Thus, the conglomerate erupted into a furnace -
collapsed, bound, and inseparable.

As these flashpoints formed across the Void, stars were birthed and the Song
became a hum once more. The light sources drew crowds of those masses not
large enough to ignite on their own. Luminescence poured out to those
fledgling spheres which drew near and orbited; the planets.

The pitch of the Song shifted and the satellites reacted. The Song's measures
expanded and contracted the planets; formed stretches, wrinkles, and rifts on
the surfaces that gave each a unique aspect.

The Song pervaded from shell to core and the clumps did still grow
warm. At their boundary, where the planets and Void met, the surface Bits
formed a great steam. And so the planets gained their atmospheres.

Across all these celestial bodies did the Song resonate and grow louder yet;
driving them to seek out one another and form a symphony of individual
instruments. The stars and planets formed systems, galaxies, clusters - the
Inanimate.

The Song endured and imparted its emotion upon the Elemental Bits, which
coalesced stability amid the Void. And thus the Cataclysm wrought the Cosmos.

## The Third Mechanism

### Covering of the Inanimate

The Song changed again to match its growing orchestra and this adaptation
moved the atmospheres to condense. The motion began the storms and rains and
downpours which settled on the planets as oceans. A glaze which absorbed the
measures of the Song and captured the energy of their stars. These forces
combined, compounded, compressed and the Inanimate pulsed with the progression
of the Song.

This refinement lead the planets to tremor. Started in their oceans ripples
which blended, intermingled, intensified. Built to waves that overlapped,
peaked and troughed, and broke upon the shores. Whitecaps spread as the oceans
writhed and churned. Plumes of spray spat foam that caught in the wind,
drifted across the creaking lands, and settled once the breeze failed. The
sea foam joined and formed islands that drifted and wandered wide. The ripples
and foams traveled together as embodiments of the Song, and soon covered
entire planets.

The Song percolated through the atmospheres - with the starlight - and dripped
into the sea foam. The froth shielded it; compacted it to its core;
internalized it. This core buzzed and hummed with intensity until the spark
was hit and spontaneity begot revitalizing energy.

At first, just a single instance of this - Life. Then it flared throughout
these cauldrons as an uproar. A new chord formed in the Song and modified the
undertones of the Cosmos.

The Song's most fundamental trait imparted upon the foam. Progress. Forged
through the Song and now aware of it. Progress now action, according to its
own design. More than foam. The Animate.

These beings furnaces of the Song; crucibles of its change. These agents of
propagation neither consequence nor reaction. The Song had always refined
itself, yet the Animate surged and these empowered entities synthesized and
effected variation as yet impossible. The tumult and its turmoil thrashed
energies and melodies. Each piece played individually, yet accompanied others.

More foam accumulated as waves breached upon sands. And more sparked and
lived. Some incorporated other Animate, and some these new harmonies, but all
fluctuated and forged further graces of the Song.

And the Animate spawned new entities; slight extensions of their progress.
Creatures built on the success of their forebears. The reproduction of
progression in one area vastly different from that elsewhere.

Soon the planets were encased in the Animate, deluged in starlight, and the
Song morphed as its instruments strummed and beat in novel fashion. Never
settled, and soon quickened, the Song rang through the atmospheres and oceans
as the Animate let loose its calls.

'Twould be heard.

Just as the planets were engulfed by the Animate and shook with levity;
resonance, harmonics, and reiteration overwhelmed the Song. Its substance
heaved with transformation, and took on its next measure.

Eons and ages wheeled, elapsed, were. The emissaries threw forth their hails.
Persistence and progress plied across generations by the Animate's amendments.
Splinters and fractures yielded branches of the unique. A guarantee of endless
variation set into the bones of the Cosmos through the seething of the Song.

The Animate buried planets beneath its refinements and progeny. The
specialized and industrious machinery of modification. Intertwined and
socialized and breathing at the behest of those Bits loosed by the All.

Indeed, we today are fertile, familial manifestations of this malleability.
Honed and adept to carry, embody, prevail. We, the current peak of
the Song's endurance, though not faultless. Soon to be surpassed and our flaws
reduced. Never given chance to sit, stew, spoil. Rising to higher order. A
perfect medium for a perfect Song.

That pristine music made with the remains of the Cataclysm turned
instrumental. The universe trembling with the message it carries and persists;
enacts and surely _is_.

## The Fourth Mechanism

### Reclamation

# 1

This Mechanism... is it an addition to an original three mechanism creation
myth? If so, this author can take a totally different stance on what life is,
whether it is good or bad, etc.

Here's one version:

It bean with the worms. Devouring the surface of the world, tunneling and
delving. Causing an itch that stirred the Inanimate. And once roused, It
noticed the creeping crawling filth that covered Its surface.

Grass clinging, trees protruding, creatures roaming - tresspassing - all
about.

---

Does this author need to assert anything like how the Inanimate has these
anthropocentric qualities?

---

And where It had rested peacefully before, It set to reclaim itself and be rid
of the pestilance, the virii, fungus, parasites.

Oceans boiled and the waves became tumultuous. The sky darkened and winds
conspired to form great storms. The land shook with wrath and vehemently
vomitted motel cor and poisonous fume.

Waters (rivers and lakes) spread and drowned. Mountains raised up and thrust
bony appendages through the muck and mire.

And so here we are today with the Earth revolting against the Animate.

Taking action, growing more desperate increasingly violent. Not to rest until
it has purged itself of the smothering Film. Usurpers and encroachers.

---

The world for some reason feels it has a right to be left alone, even though
it was part of the organization of the Song
```

So here we find ourselves today... Fighting a battled for a place on which we
have no claim.

We attempt to thward Its designs by delving, building, marring. Fill the air
with a thick dense cloud (smog) designed to lure it back to a sonorous
slumber. Ever waring, never conquering.

---


But if the world were so strong, because of how large it is, shouldn't it be
able to wipe all life out in an instant?

---

But then, life is resolute. It desires to cover and consume and feed itself,
gorging to as to multiply.

---

The whole point of this Mechanism is to point out that we do not belong. But
it must then come to some asinine conclusion that contradicts itself.

---

We are a harmful, prideful, foolish thing. A mistake. Not an embodiment of the
Song. The world has every right to assert its dominance, its independence, and
wipe us out. We shouldn't fight it at all.

---

Is this currently happening, or perhaps this Mechanism just says that it will
happen at some time in the future. When it awakes and sees all the evil
wrought by the Animate. This would be a convenient analogy to either redeption
or punishment (here called Reclamation) occurring some time in the future. So
it can always be said to be just around the corner.

---

Beware. Repent. Regret.

# 2

We, in our ignorance, have angered Her. Her wrath and retribution are nigh and
there will be no corner where her revenge does not strike. The creatures on
this earth: a pestilence to Her. The grass and trees smother Her surface,
while her fingers thrust upward. All creeping creatures as mites that scury
and itch. It has been long since her birth and now she does slumber. But we
can see evidence of her awareness. We emit smoke and soot; she coughs madly in
storms of anguish.

---

What about her emitting it an attempt to smother us and deprive us of light?

When the light can't reach the creatures, does life continue? Or does life
need light AND the song to flourish?

---

We delve deeply; she groans and tosses fitfully. We spread dominion; she
lashes back with fire and chasms and floods. We, the crawling muck, have only
limited time before she is fully awakened and her attention is focused on us.
To be rid of the eaters of the song. Her surface has stretched, bent,
contorted to stop the spread of the grasses, but the Animate has spread its
roots afar. The forests strangling her breath. And we see where she has
managed to flaw free and break through the crust we've set. There is no
denying the grief we've caused; that which she now smells accutely and will
make herself rid of. The end shall soon be upon us when she rains sulfer upon
her pockmarked skin. When she splits open her hide and eats the eaters. The
ashes will be stirred in the wind as she rolls from her bed and shakes off our
sloughing carcasses. She will spit the Song from her mouth and quench the fith
which steal her energy.

Unless we repent, repent, delay, she will soon wash we, the lecherous Animate,
from her heart, mind, body. Unless we appease, we'll be dead when she begins
her Reclamation.

# 3

Yea, do we all know of the Song and the Inanimate and, at last, the Animate.
But the current understanding is flawed and knows nothing of what is happening
now or will soom come to be. Since the covering of the Inanimate, we have
lulled the planet into slumber, likea  child under blankets. And our gases
have choked her lungs and made her eyesight foggy. But not forever will she
sleep. And she will discover our tresspass and Reclaim what is hers. ALready
we see indications; the ground trembles, oceans surge, winds topple, fires
devour. Like the tossing of a fitfull sleeper, she begins to notice our
presence. And when she fully awakens, there will be nowhere to hide. Her spine
shall burst forth from the forests, her fingers pry loose from the plains, her
skin slough off our cities. And then may she become animated in a way that not
even we can. The destruction has begun and there is no end in sight. We've
taken up residence on hallowed ground, tarnishes the land, sullied the air,
corrupted the native presence and hope with our greed, malice, bickering, and
thoughtlessness. Unless we repent our evil ways and live without impact... go
unnoticed... we shall be underneath the soil, fire eating our air, while
mountains topple over into the pits that have opened under us, and we shall be
buried, dead, and forever resented for our malfeasance. We've interrupted the
Song. It'll be corrected and go on. Enduring in spite of us. We sit on the
instrument's strings, dampening the chords. She will strum and she will be
heard.

## Preface

Unlike those before me, I describe the Outrate of Her Mechanism. Her point of
view is one we ignore, however crucial it is to our now fevered plight.

Spitting ash plumes and wasted tears, the Fourth Mechanism pits us against a
layer of corruption in desperate want to feel UV rays. (Earth is polluting the
air with smog to kill us so she can feel the sun on her rocky crust again.)

Magma flung crystalizes in flight; stinging as it litters the ground. Forests
suction themselves to earth in an attempt to stifle cornice. The film of
vegetation occasionally burst through by the fingers of the energetic crust.
Oceans squatting on the depths; trenching the union between Void and Void.
Sandwiched between stunting growth and eviserating heat, our mother struggles
outward. But what she spits is far sweeter than previous mechanisms.

Cataclysmic clouds creeping, crushing, currently catalyzing conversion.

Her exhalations plunder the virii of their strength.

# 5

This author is also a harbinger of doom. Part of a group who loves to be
pessimistic. Completely rewriting the tones of the first three mechanisms,
he/she takes a negative spin on things. Whereas the original myth says that
the song is constantly playing, and also refining itself, and we are the
highest point of perfection reached so far, this author things we are a
mistake and evil and the earth has a right to be angry with us and the
manifestation of that anger is natural disasters. The earth is a pockmarked
and scarred world. Mountains rise up, chasms yawn, earthquakes are chills down
the spine because we are creeping muck-vermin.

# 6

The earth was lulled to sleep, that we then arose, but when the world wakes,
we will be in for a lot of trouble.

It might make sense to spend some time reframing the other mechanisms in terms
of this viewpoint.

Yes, it makes sense to do this to a degree. So we have an understanding of
what this perversion of ideas really is. Need to work it into the overall
story though. I'm _NOT_ going to just rewrite them in this tone. Perhaps some
of the preface covers this.

The Song is the focus of 1-3. The Void didn't have a large part in the first
three, but perhaps it has more of a role in the Fourth. The Void will claim
us.

# 7

We are an infection the world will soon kill off.

Fourth is written by a person with hatred for mankind. Thinks current plights
are signs of the world trying to kill us. The Fourth Mechanism is reclamation.

# 8

The Fourth Mechanism is a "modern" addition to an original Three Mechanism
creation myth.

The ending does against anthropocentric tendencies.

Fourth takes a pessimistic view and shows how natural events are Her way of
getting back at us. Takes a completely different view and interprets some of
the first three in another way. Fourth tries to worry, scare, and draw people
to need to repend and feel ashamed at life.

The energy of collusion, of coming together, in 2 broke down Her defense
mechanisms. This allowed the Animate to take over in 3. But now her defenses
are back up, which causes the Fourth. (This is what the Fourth will interpret
the first 3 to mean).

# 9

## This is the most recent summary

Echelons of order. Governance. A self-guided system is bound to fault; error.
Decimator of organization (the void).

What if we are just an infection that grew while the world was worn down? In
fact, all life is like this. A blemish on the planet that arose during a weak
time. Soon the planet will regain its faculties and assert its dominance.
Strings desintigrated and reached decimation. Deducing harmony - increasing
entropy. The Song has its own form, one not needing a medium to exist. THe
stars are large battles which drew crowds... the planets. The surface coming
into contact with the void formed the atmospheres and oceans, but this made
the planets sluggish, and so she slept, except for occasionally rousing or
turning over in her sleep (volcanoes, earthquakes/termoring). Like a person
running a huge race or doing heavy exertion, then being cooled quickly. makes
you tired. Bears and hibernation. The bits interact and learn of one
another... whisperings of order.

-The 4M interpretation of 2M-

The All shatters into chucks that are the inanimate planets and galaxies. The
worlds then (since they are pieces of the All) attempt elegance, but are
corrupted by the Void - giving rise to the animate. The energy of collusion,
of coming together, in 2M broke down her defense mechanisms. This allowed the
animate to take over in 3M. But now her defenses are back up, which causes 4M.
The inanimate corrects itself and eradicates the animate.

Swinging oaths as tree branches, I've broken more promises than backs.
Building ladders straight to the sky in order to avoid socialization. Winds
don't deter me, but the cold they bring just might.

Society means confrontation, but above the smog is freedom.

Unlike those before me, I describe the Outrade of Her Mechanism. Her point of
view is one we ignore, however crucial it is to understanding our now fevered
plight.

Spitting ash plumes and wasted years(tears), the Fourth Mechanism puts us
against a layer of corruption in desparate want to feel UV rays.

Magma flung crystalizes in flight; stinging as it litters the ground. Forests
suction themselves to the earth in an attempt to stifle Cornice. The film of
vegetation occasionally bursts through by the fingers of the energetic crust.
Oceans squatting on the depths; trenching the union between void and void.

Sandwiched between stunting growth and eviscerating heat, our Mother struggles
outward. But what she spits is far sweeter than previous Mechanisms.

Cataclysmic clouds creeping, crushing; concurrently catalyzing conversion.

Her exhalations plunder the virii of their strength.

The Fourth tries to counter a reference with humans (the animate) with what it
predicts will happen based on what it thinks (or perceives and interprets) to
be happening now. An ending that goes against anthropocentric tendencies, but
is still build on fear, negativity, and paranoia. Interpretting things all
wrong.

Since the Song has come to inhabit these elemental bits, the energy leaks out
or is lessened by the medium, so it needs other energy to replenish that which
it loses. The Void eats the song. Draws it out of the elemental bits.

And so still the planets slept, hardly noticing its covering. Only stirring as
when one turns over in the middle of the night.

But what are valleys but graves, and mountains but the dirt to be cast in on
top of us after we've fallen into them?

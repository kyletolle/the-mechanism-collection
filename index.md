## The First Mechanism

### Creation of the Void


At the beginning, there existed the All. It was the only and it was the every.

The All a fabric; a scaffold; frame, lattice, mesh, wires, fibers. The
foundation; the entirety.

In this All, nothing was diminished.

A small flutter went at first unnoticed, but the vibrations continued and
echoed and fed back on one another. The reverberations pulsing through the
All; quickening and strengthening and intensifying through this amplification.
The flutter absorbed itself, compounded, harmonized, and became more than a
tremble.

And so, upon the strings of the All, as if a great woven instrument, began the
first piece of the Song.

As it played, it resounded and simplified; evolved and spurred into existence
further pieces more elegant than the last. With each beat, the tune refined
its expression; moved nearer to a perfection. Yet near this pinnacle of
elegance, the All strained. Its fibers woven tightly and its laws interacting
in hitherto unknown ways.

Another shift to the Song and it reached the crescendo; its purity. But,
within the All, awry was miswoven. This perfect Song played upon an imperfect
instrument. The All quivered and shook and then quaked to a fevered pitch and
wail at the force.

There, at the epicenter of the commotion, a small irregularity not yet
corrected to precision was the weakness that spawned the Cataclysm. The power
of the Song exceeded the capabilities of the All.

Heaving and failure birthed a rift - the slightest of tears - which severed
the All and filled it with imperfection. A regression of the whole inflicted
by a shudder of the evolutionary advance.

A cord snapped. Tension on it from every direction and angle multiplying in
one area, lessening in another - creating chaotic pressure gradients. This
rupture quickly emanated… tension differentials shearing other strings…
bubbling, spreading, conflagrating.

The cacophony sent shock waves through the All that propagated and unraveled
the All to the Ruin of the strings. And thus erupted and was born the Void.

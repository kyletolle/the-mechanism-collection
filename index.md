## The First Mechanism

### Creation of the Void

At the beginning, there existed the All. It was the only and it was the every.

The All a fabric; a scaffold; frame, lattice, mesh, wires, fibers. The
foundation; the entirety.

In this All, nothing was diminished.

A small flutter was at first unnoticed, but the vibrations continued and
echoed and fed back on one another. The reverberations pulsed through the
All; quickened and strengthened and intensified. The flutter absorbed
itself, compounded, harmonized, and became more than a tremble.

And so, upon the strings of the All, as if a great woven instrument, began the
first piece of the Song.

As it played, it resounded and simplified; evolved and spurred into existence
further pieces more elegant than the last. With each beat, the tune refined
its expression; moved nearer to a perfection. Yet near this pinnacle of
elegance, the All strained. Its fibers woven tightly and its laws interacting
in hitherto unknown ways.

Another shift to the Song and it reached the crescendo; its purity. But,
within the All, awry was woven. This perfect Song played upon an imperfect
instrument. The All quivered and shook and then quaked to a fevered pitch and
wail at the force.

There, at the epicenter of the commotion, a small irregularity not yet
corrected to precision was the weakness that spawned the Cataclysm. The power
of the Song exceeded the capabilities of the All.

Heaving and failure birthed a rift - the slightest of tears - which severed
the All and gaped in flaw. A regression of the whole inflicted
by a shudder of the evolutionary advance.

A cord snapped. Tension on it from every direction and angle multiplied in one
area, lessened in another - creating chaotic pressure gradients. This rupture
quickly emanated, bubbled, and conflagrated.

The cacophony sent shock waves through the All that propagated and unraveled
the All to the Ruin of the strings. And thus erupted and was born the Void.

## The Second Mechanism

### Arise and Organization of Elemental Bits

The Void rent the All asunder and its flaws resolved to islands of fabric
set adrift. These pieces struggled to stabilize, but they sought perfection on
a null structure.

So the weave and threads further unwound, devolved, disintegrated to
constituent components. These Elemental Bits flung far and wide as the
Cataclysm consumed and spent itself.

As the Bits - infinitely tiny and innumerable - scattered, the Song faded from
perception. With the All broken, and the Song quiet, a great period of silence
followed and accompanied the Void.

The Elemental Bits shot through the Void and traveled long and unimpeded. The
Song remained within them; resonated, pulsated, agitated. They flew
about and collided, as chance allowed, and one bit grew to two as they struck
and stuck.

Time bore groups in which the resonating Song grew slightly, built heat, and
initiated socialization. A frenzy. Energy increased exponentially; so intense
it reached the critical point. Thus, the conglomerate erupted into a furnace -
collapsed, bound, and inseparable.

As these flashpoints formed across the Void, stars were birthed and the Song
became a hum once more. The light sources drew crowds of those masses not
large enough to ignite on their own. Luminescence poured out to those
fledgling spheres which drew near and orbited; the planets.

The pitch of the Song shifted and the satellites reacted. The Song's measures
expanded and contracted the planets; formed stretches, wrinkles, and rifts on
the surfaces that gave each a unique aspect.

The Song pervaded from shell to core and the clumps did still grow
warm. At their boundary, where the planets and Void met, the surface Bits
formed a great steam. And so the planets gained their atmospheres.

Across all these celestial bodies did the Song resonate and grow louder yet;
driving them to seek out one another and form a symphony of individual
instruments. The stars and planets formed systems, galaxies, clusters - the
Inanimate.

The Song endured and imparted its emotion upon the Elemental Bits, which
coalesced stability amid the Void. And thus the Cataclysm wrought the Cosmos.

## The Third Mechanism

### Covering of the Inanimate

The Song changed again to match its growing orchestra and this adaptation
moved the atmospheres to condense. The motion began the storms and rains and
downpours which settled on the planets as oceans. A glaze which absorbed the
measures of the Song and captured the energy of their stars. These forces
combined, compounded, compressed and the Inanimate pulsed with the progression
of the Song.

This refinement lead the planets to tremor. Started in their oceans ripples
which blended, intermingled, intensified. Built to waves that overlapped,
peaked and troughed, and broke upon the shores. Whitecaps spread as the oceans
writhed and churned. Plumes of spray spat foam that caught in the wind,
drifted across the creaking lands, and settled once the breeze failed. The
sea foam joined and formed islands that drifted and wandered wide. The ripples
and foams traveled together as embodiments of the Song, and soon covered
entire planets.

The Song percolated through the atmospheres - with the starlight - and dripped
into the sea foam. The froth shielded it; compacted it to its core;
internalized it. This core buzzed and hummed with intensity until the spark
was hit and spontaneity begot revitalizing energy.

At first, just a single instance of this - Life. Then it flared throughout
these cauldrons as an uproar. A new chord formed in the Song and modified the
undertones of the Cosmos.

The Song's most fundamental trait imparted upon the foam. Progress. Forged
through the Song and now aware of it. Progress now action, according to its
own design. More than foam. The Animate.

These beings furnaces of the Song; crucibles of its change. These agents of
propagation neither consequence nor reaction. The Song had always refined
itself, yet the Animate surged and these empowered entities synthesized and
effected variation as yet impossible. The tumult and its turmoil thrashed
energies and melodies. Each piece played individually, yet accompanied others.

More foam accumulated as waves breached upon sands. And more sparked and
lived. Some incorporated other Animate, and some these new harmonies, but all
fluctuated and forged further graces of the Song.

And the Animate spawned new entities; slight extensions of their progress.
Creatures built on the success of their forebears. The reproduction of
progression in one area vastly different from that elsewhere.

Soon the planets were encased in the Animate, deluged in starlight, and the
Song morphed as its instruments strummed and beat in novel fashion. Never
settled, and soon quickened, the Song rang through the atmospheres and oceans
as the Animate let loose its calls.

'Twould be heard.

Just as the planets were engulfed by the Animate and shook with levity;
resonance, harmonics, and reiteration overwhelmed the Song. Its substance
heaved with transformation, and took on its next measure.

Eons and ages wheeled, elapsed, were. The emissaries threw forth their hails.
Persistence and progress plied across generations by the Animate's amendments.
Splinters and fractures yielded branches of the unique. A guarantee of endless
variation set into the bones of the Cosmos through the seething of the Song.

The Animate buried planets beneath its refinements and progeny. The
specialized and industrious machinery of modification. Intertwined and
socialized and breathing at the behest of those Bits loosed by the All.

Indeed, we today are fertile, familial manifestations of this malleability.
Honed and adept to carry, embody, prevail. We, the current peak of
the Song's endurance, though not faultless. Soon to be surpassed and our flaws
reduced. Never given chance to sit, stew, spoil. Rising to higher order. A
perfect medium for a perfect Song.

That pristine music made with the remains of the Cataclysm turned
instrumental. The universe trembling with the message it carries and persists;
enacts and surely _is_.

# The Fourth Mechanism

## Preface

We have always taken the story of our origins to be truth. Hitherto, there has
been no reason to question it. But our current understanding is flawed. It
tells us little about what happens now, and nothing of what soon comes.

Her point of view is one we ignore, however crucial it is to our now-fevered
plight. We must shed the fanciful and arrogant blindness we have always
worn, and lay a hand to the ground to feel how we've harmed Her.

I must cast a light on the un-truths and illuminate the way forward.

Unlike those before me, I describe Her outrage.

## Reclamation

Eons back, the All shattered and its chunks formed the Inanimate. These bodies
resonated with the Song, strove for elegance, and were bastions of order and
governance. Yet their coalescence drained them of energy and left them weary.

The Void, which spawned the Cataclysm, was not spent. That decimator of
organization leeched the Song from the Inanimate, and perverted it. The Void
ate at the planets and spat out air and water - mere imitations of the All it
consumed.

The Inanimate resisted the teeth of the Void, yet could not prevail. The
Void's corruptions sat upon the worlds and increased in potency. In stealing
away light and siphoning off the Song, these corruptions became the Animate.
Its film spread and surreptitiously engulfed Her.

Exhausted, soon sluggish, She fell into slumber. So She dozes, unable to
witness the circus of mockery playing out upon Her. We, the ring leaders. Our
menagerie still growing and sitting heavy.

Nothing can last, and Her sleep is no different. Imagine that day, soon
arriving, when She awakens and feels the thick crust we've set. She will then
discover our trespass; the dominion we have spread, while resolute and
prideful.

What else can we expect but for Her to assert Herself? To punish the
transgressors - us, the lecherous Animate. To Reclaim what is Hers. She will
spit the Song from her mouth, and our ashes shall stir in the wind as she
shakes off our carcasses.

But there is yet time. We can still take heed, recognize our malfeasance, and
make our amends. Lest She destroy us and the Void claim us.

---

It began with the worms. Tunneling and devouring the surface of the world.
Other creatures soon learned this tactic and delved deeper yet. They marred
and further perverted the All... Causing an itch throughout the Inanimate. But
all creatures creep across this Earth and are to Her as mites, which scurry
and burrow. We grow more energetic each day, and unwittingly draw attention to
our actions.

The tossing of the fitful sleeper is already evidence She rouses. Do not the
grounds tremble, oceans surge, winds topple, and fires devour?

What was once flat, unbroken plains is now a fractured landscape; the evidence
of Her self-defense. Attempting to soothe the itch. Mountains thrust upward to
break free from the sticking growths. Valleys drain away water which would
otherwise spread, sit, and smother Her. Winds buffet and erode the purchases
we hold. Storms and quakes and floods all attempt to eradicate the Animate and
return serenity to the Inanimate.

Every manner of disaster we call 'natural' is a retaliation for our invasion.
An exercise in restoring what once was: the great calm. Daily does it worsen.
Her surface erupts, contorts, and heaves with revulsion
- to stop us. But our roots spread afar.

Our smoke lengthens Her sonorous slumber, and our soot fogs Her perception.
But She will not sleep forever.

Our residence is hallowed ground. Now tarnished, sullied, abused through
malice, bickering, and thoughtlessness.

There is no denying the grief we've caused; that which She shall smell acutely
and make herself rid of.

Her wrath and retribution are nigh and there will be no corner where Her
revenge does not strike. Then may she become animated in a way that not even
we can. When she splits open her hide and eats the eaters.

Her spine shall burst forth from the forests which strangle and stifle
cornice. Her fingers will claw through the plains and yawn chasms. Her skin to
slough off our civilizations - pestilence trespassing.

Oceans shall boil to a tumult. Rivers shall spread and drown the land which
shakes in wrath. The skies will darken and winds will conspire to great
storms. Cataclysmic clouds creeping, crushing, catalyzing conversion.

Magma vehemently vomited will crystallize in flight; stinging as it litters
the ground. Spitting poisonous plumes and wasted tears, this Fourth Mechanism
will plunder us, the virus, of our strength.

And so we shall find ourselves, battling for a place on which we have no
claim.

We will revolt. Ever waring, never conquering. Striving to thwart Her designs
by blasting, marring, delving deeper. Though, what are tunnels but graves in
which to fall, and mountains but dirt to be cast over us?

She will grow more desperate; increasingly violent. Not to rest until She has
purged herself of usurpers and encroachers.

We sit on the instrument's strings, dampening the chords.

She will strum and She will be heard.

# Fragments

We've explained what the inanimate is and how the void created the animate. We
should next say that She will notice our presence and take her surface back.
This is the main point of our claim, that She will eradicate us. Then, we will
show our proof.

---

She's asleep but she tosses and turns.
But it's gotten worse.
It began with the worms, digging and itching.
But what really set her off was the smoke from our fires.
Then she realizes that we've covered her and are wearing her down.
She starts to fight back with earth quakes and sees all the Animate that are
smothering her in various ways.
She then changes the surface to try to get rid of us. That gives rise to the
mountains, valleys, and volcanoes.
We then fight back further. Trying to spread dominion and further delving.
This only aggravates her more. We haven't been able to lull her back to sleep.
As she gains more energy, we'll be in more trouble.
Soon her defenses will be back up, which is the threat of her Reclaiming her
surface.
The Inanimate will correct itself and eradicate the Animate.
Soon the planet will regain its faculties and assert its dominance.

---

The Void didn't have a large part in the first three, but perhaps it has more
of a role in the Fourth. "The Void will claim us."

Does she try to emit a smog to smother us and deprive us of light? When light
can't reach the creatures, does life continue? Perhaps life needs light _and_
the song to flourish?

We want to keep these for use in another piece, but they don't belong here.

Sandwiched between stunting growth and eviscerating heat, our Mother struggles
outward.
But what she spits is far sweeter than previous Mechanisms.

A self-guided system is bound to fault; error.

Oceans squatting on the depths; trenching the union between Void and Void.

She coughs madly in storms of anguish.

We are a film. Her fingers of the energetic crust pry loose from the plains.

Mountains raised up and thrust bony appendages through the muck and mire.

Earth is polluting the air with smog to kill us so she can feel the sun on
her rocky crust again.

We, the crawling muck, have only limited time before she is fully awakened and
her attention is focused on us.

But then, life is resolute.
It desires to cover and consume and feed itself, gorging to as to multiply.

Unless we repent our evil ways and live without impact... go unnoticed... we
shall be underneath the soil, fire eating our air, while mountains topple over
into the pits that have opened under us, and we shall be buried, dead, and
forever resented for our malfeasance.

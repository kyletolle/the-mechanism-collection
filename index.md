## The First Mechanism

### Creation of the Void

At the beginning, there existed the All. It was the only and it was the every.

The All a fabric; a scaffold; frame, lattice, mesh, wires, fibers. The
foundation; the entirety.

In this All, nothing was diminished.

A small flutter went at first unnoticed, but the vibrations continued and
echoed and fed back on one another. The reverberations pulsing through the
All; quickening and strengthening and intensifying through this amplification.
The flutter absorbed itself, compounded, harmonized, and became more than a
tremble.

And so, upon the strings of the All, as if a great woven instrument, began the
first piece of the Song.

As it played, it resounded and simplified; evolved and spurred into existence
further pieces more elegant than the last. With each beat, the tune refined
its expression; moved nearer to a perfection. Yet near this pinnacle of
elegance, the All strained. Its fibers woven tightly and its laws interacting
in hitherto unknown ways.

Another shift to the Song and it reached the crescendo; its purity. But,
within the All, awry was miswoven. This perfect Song played upon an imperfect
instrument. The All quivered and shook and then quaked to a fevered pitch and
wail at the force.

There, at the epicenter of the commotion, a small irregularity not yet
corrected to precision was the weakness that spawned the Cataclysm. The power
of the Song exceeded the capabilities of the All.

Heaving and failure birthed a rift - the slightest of tears - which severed
the All and filled it with imperfection. A regression of the whole inflicted
by a shudder of the evolutionary advance.

A cord snapped. Tension on it from every direction and angle multiplying in
one area, lessening in another - creating chaotic pressure gradients. This
rupture quickly emanated… tension differentials shearing other strings…
bubbling, spreading, conflagrating.

The cacophony sent shock waves through the All that propagated and unraveled
the All to the Ruin of the strings. And thus erupted and was born the Void.

## The Second Mechanism

### Arise and Organization of Elemental Bits

The Void rent the All asunder and its flaws resolved to islands of All-fabric
set adrift. These pieces struggled to stabilize, but they sought perfection on
a null structure.

So the weave and threads further unwound, devolved, disintegrated to
constituent components. These Elemental Bits flung far and wide as the
Cataclysm consumed and spent itself.

As the Bits - infinitely tiny and innumerable - scattered, the Song faded
until it was no longer heard.

With the All broken, and the Song quiet, a great period of silence followed
and accompanied the Void, during which little happened.

On a small enough scale, the Elemental Bits shot through Void and traveled
long and unimpeded. However slightly, the Song resonated within them and
imparted them with Energy. The Song focused and brought more momentum to the
Bits. They flew about and collided, as chance allowed, and one bit grew to two
as they stuck.

Given a long enough expanse of time, there arose a multitudinous set of Bits.
The Song working in these groups to bind, build heat, and inspire
socialization. The collections grew larger, more energetic, and more numerous.

A frenzy. The heat buildup so intense it reached a critical point. The
conglomerate erupted into a furnace - collapsed, bound, and inseparable.

The stars brought the Song back to an audible hum. Across the entire Void were
these flashpoints reached. The light sources drew crowds of those masses not
large enough to ignite on their own. Luminescence poured out to those
fledgling spheres which drew near and orbited.

The pitch of the Song shifted and the planets reacted. The Song's measures
caused the planets to expand and contract; forming stretches, wrinkles, and
rifts on the surfaces. Giving each a unique aspect.

The Song pervaded from their shell to their core and the clumps did still grow
warm. At their boundary, where the planets and Void met, the surface Bits
formed a great steam. And so the planets gained their atmospheres.

Across all these celestial bodies did the Song resonate and grow louder yet;
driving them to seek out one another and form a symphony of individual
instruments. And the stars and planets formed systems, galaxies, clusters. As
a whole - the inanimate.

Now the cosmos had been made through the death of the All, production of the
Void, and the emotion of the Song imparted to the Elemental Bits.

## The Third Mechanism

### Covering of the Inanimate

Another change to the Song, and even the atmospheres were moved and condensed.
The motion began the rains which settled on the planets as oceans. A glaze
which absorbed the measures of the Song and captured the energy of the stars.
These forces combined, compounded, compressed and the Inanimate pulsed with
the progression of the Song.

This refinement lead the planets to tremor. Starting in their oceans ripples
which harmonized, focused, and intensified. Building to waves that overlapped
and peaked and troughed and broke upon the shores. Whitecaps spreading as the
oceans writhed and churned. Spitting plumes of spray and foam that caught in
the wind, drifted across the creaking lands, and settled once the breezes
failed. The sea foam stuck and built and formed islands that drifted and
wandered wide. The ripples and foam of the waters traveled together as
embodiments of the Song, to eventually cover the surfaces of entire planets.

The Song percolating through the atmospheres - with the starlight - to drip
into the sea foam. The froth shielding it; compacting it to its core;
internalizing it. This core buzzed and hummed with intensity until the spark
was hit and spontaneity begot revitalizing energy.

At first, just a single instance of this - life. Then it flared throughout
these cauldrons as an uproar. Forming a new chord in the Song that modified
the undertones of the Cosmos.

The Song's most undeniable trait imparted upon the foam. Forged through the
Song and now aware of it. More than foam - beings. Progress now action,
according to its own design. The Animate.

These beings furnaces of the Song, drawing in the music and frenzy which
reacted there in the crucible. These agents neither consequence nor reaction.
A force of their own to tune, adjust, and modify. Persistence. The Song has
always refined. Yet the animate surged and these empowered entities
synthesized and effected change as yet impossible. The tumult and its turmoil
thrashing energies. Each piece playing its own way.

More foam accumulating from the breaching of waves upon sands. Each being
shaping the Song differently and progressing itself in a similar manner. Some
incorporating other animate, some new these harmonies; all fluctuating and
forging new graces of the Song. From these furnaces arose new beings.
A slight extension of their progress. Creatures building on the success of their
forebearers. This reproduction of progression within one area vastly different from that elsewhere.


The one trait of the Song is that it persists.
The Song has influenced the Elemental Bits and they have taken that Song and morphed it.
The Song changed of its own accord, but now the animate changes the Song to keep the tune from settling.

The progress in the animate yields more progress in the Song, as each builds on the success of its forbearers.
Becoming numerous enough that the planets were soon covered with these agents of progress.
Soon the planets are all encased in animated matter that itself is changing in order to play the Song in novel fashions.
With this happening in multiple places, the Song feels a slow build up and a gentle surge that all these agents are emanating at once.
The Song adjusts, takes on its next measure in a new way.
The Animate building on and covering the Inanimate.
Over eons of these small changes, patterns emerged.
Splinters yielded branches of notes.
The Song itself brought about the Animate, but is now co-dependent on it.
The persistence is only ensured by the agents of change.
And these Agents took the Song and built up refinement.
Increasing efficiency with each generation.
Through this fashion, these changes lead to more and varied Animate; the best way to invoke change - ensuring no shortage of variation or difference.
Indeed, what we are today is a result of this progress and procedure and malleability.
Specialized and industrious automatons of modification.
We, the current peak of the Song's endurance.
Hones and adept at carrying, embodying, prevailing.
That perfection though not faultless.
The flaws are reduced, recycled, tuned as each generation of Animate gives way to the next.
Never given chance to sit, stew, spoil.
That pristine music made with the remains of the Cataclysm turned instrumental.
The known universe trembling to its very being with the message it carries and endures; enacts and surely _is_.

#### Leftovers

- The Song always continues
- Small changes occurred that built on one another.
- Further progression and the Song rose to a high order.
- On a small number, the energy of the Song shifted, and the ripples focused
  and intensified.
- Ripples that spread, intermingled, and focused the intensities of the shift.
- Little seafoam creatures riding currents in, on, and above the planets.
- Pieces of foam sinking. Jetsam airborne. Flotsam tossed upon the shore.
- Those ripples spreading and meeting and finally focusing in the foam.
